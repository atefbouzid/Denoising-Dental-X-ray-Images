# Denoising Dental X-ray Images

## Overview
This repository contains the code and paper for an academic project focused on denoising dental X-ray images. The project provided an opportunity to explore practical aspects of the Signal Processing field, particularly in Image Processing. A comparison was made between two denoising techniques: BM3D and Convolutional Autoencoders.

## Paper
